# Tests


## Preliminaries

You are already set if you installed `dapy` with the `dev` option (or `--all-groups`) and can directly skip to running the tests.

Install `pytest` if not already there:
```shell
uv pip install pytest
```

Setup the project by installing the package with `pip`:
```shell
uv pip install --editable .
```

## Running tests

From the root directory:

```shell
uv run pytest
```
